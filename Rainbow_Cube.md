# Rainbow Cube Kit (Assembled)
----
**Rainbow Cube** is a 3D RGB LED Cube useful for creating colorful design. The 3D Cube is artistically crafted with sixty-four 8mm RGB LEDs arranged in a 4 x 4 x 4 manner. Rainbow Cube can be used to create many beautiful visual effects with A Rainbowduino. The Rainbow Cube comes with an inbuilt 3.3V / 1 Amp LDO useful for powering the independently. A XBee compatible socket is provided as well, this can be used to connect Rainbowduino with a PC or an Arduino wirelessly.

##Mechanical Dimensions
Assembled cube is of approx. of 10cm (l) X 10cm (b) X 12cm (h) dimension.

##Understanding the Schematic
To easily understand the working of Rainbow Cube, a very simplified schematic is presented below. In essence, 64 RGB LEDs are arranged in a form consisting of 8 common anodes(positive pins) and 8 common cathodes(gtound pins) for each color Red, Green and Blue.
The complete schematic of RGB Cube is represented in a 2D RGB LED Matrix form below.
Numbers 1 - 32 indicates the pin number of the 2x16 pin header shown above.
